 Hey Guys, I am driven crazy tonight by the python KMeans.
 The question is so dumb and I can't understand any of it.
 I hate this assignment.

Despite KMeans best effort, Daniel triumphed over the puny data structuring algorithm. Daniel's hatred for this assignment threatened to boil over when suddenly he experienced a moment of clarity; the story section of the assignment was of absolutely no consequence. It was simply a rudimentary test of his ability to remotely edit code using GitHub! Daniel's perseverance paid off when he finally committed and pushed his last file to GitHub... Until the next assignment!
