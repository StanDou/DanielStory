 Hey Guys, I am driven crazy tonight by the python KMeans.
 The question is so dumb and I can't understand any of it.
 I hate this assignment.

Despite KMeans best effort, Daniel triumphed over the puny data structuring algorithm. Daniel's hatred for this assignment threatened to boil over when suddenly he experienced a moment of clarity; the story section of the assignment was of absolutely no consequence. It was simply a rudimentary test of his ability to remotely edit code using GitHub! Daniel's perseverance paid off when he finally committed and pushed his last file to GitHub... Until the next assignment!

Thinking it over, Daniel wondered whether or not the instructor would accept his interpretation of the assignment. He imagined that his teammates would likely agree that he had understood the crucial elements of the assignment and it could be argued that his submission was within the project guidelines. Perhaps Daniel really was the character in his own story...

After two teammates had already clarified Daniel's interpretation, Tom's job was easy. All he had to do was reiterate their points. 
Tom agreed that Daniel had triumphed over the puny data structuring algorithm! Tom also thought the instructor would accept his interpretation of the assignment! Overall, Tom was glad everyone now knew how to use github.

Fortunately, I have already figured out all problems and get full score! That's so nice!
